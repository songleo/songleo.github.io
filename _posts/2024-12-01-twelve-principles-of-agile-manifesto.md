- 我们的首要任务是通过尽早并持续交付有价值的软件，使客户满意。
> our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

- 欢迎需求的变化，即使是在开发后期。敏捷过程利用变化来为客户创造竞争优势。
> welcome changing requirements, even late in development. agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

- 经常交付可工作的软件，周期从几周到几个月不等，倾向于较短的周期。
> deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

- 业务人员和开发人员必须在整个项目过程中每天都一起工作。
> business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

- 以积极主动的个体为核心来构建项目，给予他们所需的环境和支持，并相信他们能够完成工作。
> build projects around motivated individuals. give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

- 传递信息的最有效且最具效率的方法是面对面的交流。
> the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

- 工作的软件是衡量进度的首要指标。
> working software is the primary measure of progress.

- 敏捷过程提倡可持续开发。赞助者、开发者和用户应该能够一直保持一个稳定的开发节奏。
> agile processes promote sustainable development. the sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- 对技术卓越和良好设计的持续关注有助于增强敏捷性。
> continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

- 简洁——尽量减少不必要的工作——是根本。
> simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.

- 最好的架构、需求和设计出自自组织团队。
> the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

- 团队会定期反思如何变得更有效率，并相应地调整自己的行为以改进表现。
> at regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
