# an unusual day

Kathy usually gets up at 6:30, but this morning she didn't hear her alarm.

as a result, she overslept.

she didn't get up until 7 o'clock, 15 minuts later than usual.

today Kathy and her kids left home early, they usually leave home at 7:30, but today they left at 7:15.

they left early because they had to buy breakfast on their way to school.

it usually takes 45 minuts to drive her kids to school, but today took longer.

it took them longer, because they stop for breakfast on their way.

it took 45 minuts for them to have breakfast.

they ate at a litte coffee shop along the side of road.

after eating breakfast, they go back into their car.

on most days, the traffic isn't too bad in the morning.

but this morning, it was much worse than usual.

the cars were moving very slowly.

as a result, it took them longer to go to school.

one of the children got to school on time, but the other two were late.

they were late because the schools are farther away.

they were both about 15 minuts late to go to school

when Kathy finally got home, she cleant her home as usual.

she vancum the living room, and clean the bathroom

then she talk with her friend on the phone as usual.

when she finished talking with her friend, she got into her car.

she put the key into the ignition and tried to start the engine.

but the car's engine didn't start.

her car battery was dead, so she had to call for help.

after getting the new battery for her car, the engine started.

then Kathy drove to the mall to meet her friend.

she arrived the mall an hour later, but her friend was waiting for her.

they had launch together, and they went shopping.

they both bought new shoes and somethings for their kids.

Kathy bought a new tie for her husband.
