# time zones

our planet the earth is sear planet from the sun.

it is a beautiful roatings sphere.

the side facing the sun is in daylight.

the side facing away from the sun is in darkness.

for example, when it's daytime in the us, it's nigthtime in china.

in fact, there is 12 hour time difference between boston and shanghai.

when it is midnight in shanghai, it is noon in boston.

the earth rotates from west to east.

to know whick dirction is west or east, watch the sun.

the sun travels to the sky from east to west.

the sun comes up in the east, and gose down in the west.

again, this is because the earth rotates.

it takes 24 hours for the earth to make a complete rotation.

and that it's lenth of 1 day.

because the earth rotation, the earth is divided into time zones.

some contries such as the us have servral time zones.

when it's ten in newyork, it's 7 in scanfransico.

bus no.60 was supposed to come at 8:30, but yesterday it didn't come until 8:40. it was 10 minutes late.

instead, he gets on bus no.60, which comes at 8:40.

he didn't notice that it was the wrong bus.
