they left early because they had to buy breakfast on their way to school.

it usually takes 45 minutes to drive her kids to school, but today it took longer.

on most days, the traffic isn't too bad in the morning.

but this morning, it was much worse than usual.

the cars were moving very slowly.

as a result, it took them longer than usual to get to school.

one of her children got to school on time, but the other two were late.

they were late because their schools are farther away.

they were both about 10 minutes late to go to school

when kathy finally got home, she cleaned her house as usual.

she vacuumed the living room and cleaned the bathroom

when she finished talking with her friend, she got into her car.

she put the key into the ignition and tried to start the engine.

but her car's engine didn't start.

her car battery was dead, so she had to call for help.

after getting a new battery for her car, the engine started.

# bus schedule

here is a bus schedule at a bus stop.

on most days, the buses come on schedule, but sometimes they don't.

yesterday, for example, several buses were late.

this is because the traffic yesterday was much heavier (worse) than usual.

bus no.38 was supposed to come at 8:40, but it was 5 minutes late, it didn't come until 8:45.

bus no.60 was supposed to come at 8:30, but yesterday it didn't come until 8:40. it was 10 minutes late.

not one bus came early.

as a result of the delays, one man got on the wrong bus.

he wanted to go to the airport, so he wanted to get on bus no.38

he expected it to come at 8:40.

instead, he gets on bus no.60, which comes at 8:40.

he didn't notice that it was the wrong bus.

it didn't go to the airport, as a result, he missed his flight.
